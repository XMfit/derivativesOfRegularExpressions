Need to do:

String to rose tree
Fix up some cases with derive.hs
?a -> should only accept "", "a". Currently accepts "aa, ..."
(a*)+ -> should accept "", "a", "aa...". Doesn't accept ""

Input processing still needs to do be done.

Can't use do (not allowed in project specification), must use interact.
